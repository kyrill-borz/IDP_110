## How to store code

Each function should be in it's own .cpp file, and then imported into the main thing, so that unit testing can work

## How the code should work

The Robot Starts in the box. There should be a function that drives and checks if the robot is following the line. At a crossroad, the robot should decide whether to go left, right, or forward. This decision is predetermined by the route the robot is taking (The robot will go to the 2 houses first, and then the two factories). When it gets to the block, it should sense what the block is, pick it up properly, and deliver it to the correct section, by following a predetermined route that gets to either delivery spot. The robot should then execute the return to home function.
